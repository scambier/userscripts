## What are userscripts, and how to install them

Userscripts are kind of micro-addons for your browser. They're typically simple JavaScript files that are automatically executed on specific site, to alter their behavior or appearance.

They are managed with a "real" add-on, usually [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
